            Inhabited since prehistoric times, this <strong>Nabataean</strong> caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea and the
            <strong>Dead Sea,</strong> was an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia. Petra is half-built,half-carved into the rock,
            and is surrounded by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one of the world'smost famous archaeological sites, where ancient 
            <strong>Eastern</strong> traditions blend with <strong>Hellenistic</strong> architecture.
